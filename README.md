I'm a undergraduate student majoring in Information Systems. My passion lies in the intersection of technology and creativity. I'm passionate about web development, deep learning and weirdly regex. I explore both the backend and frontend of web applications. I'm also a huge fan of games such as Minecraft and I love creating plugins for servers in my break time. 

## ðŸŒ± I'm Currently Learning
- Deep learning techniques and frameworks.
- Advanced web development tools and practices.
- Some kind of Regex (my chubby baby <3)
- A bit of Spring
